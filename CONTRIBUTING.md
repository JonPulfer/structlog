# Contributing guide

This library is mainly being developed in my spare time to give me a simple structured logging implementation aimed at 
use cases with fairly flat structures. This lends itself to encapsulating useful pieces of information that will be
commonly searched for when understanding system behaviour.

## Types of contribution

These are just a few ways you can help this library become a clear, easy to use logging library.

    * Check and improve the documentation
    * Add tests to help spot problems and show how the library functions can be used.
    * Feature requests that would help make the library more useful for you.
    * Log issues when you encounter problems
    
## Respect for others

Please be mindful that everyone is offering their time, effort and experience just to improve this library for everyone. It 
may not seem clear or important to you what value another persons contribution adds but that view is from your own sphere of
experience that may not yet encompass something that is important to the contributor.
